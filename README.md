These are my [EECS 280](https://eecs280staff.github.io/eecs280.org/) notes for the Fall 2018 semester with [Nicole Hamilton](https://eecs280staff.github.io/eecs280.org/staff/). I'm using [Macdown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com) to take these notes. Feel free to clone this repo and pull from master on Mondays and Wednesdays, as I update it after my 9:00 - 10:30 AM classes every Monday and Wednesday.
